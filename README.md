Restaurants Platform
Project Overview

The Restaurants Platform is an ASP.NET Core Web API that facilitates the management and ordering of food items from various restaurants. This platform allows users to create, update, and view orders, along with detailed information about the food items and restaurants.
Key Features

    Order Management: Users can create and update orders with multiple food items from different restaurants.
    Restaurant and Food Item Association: Orders are linked to specific restaurants and food items, ensuring data integrity and a smooth user experience.
    Robust Error Handling: The project includes validation checks and error handling mechanisms to ensure that null or invalid data does not break the application.

Technologies Used

    ASP.NET Core: Web API framework for building RESTful services.
    Entity Framework Core: Object-relational mapper (ORM) for database interactions.
    Postgres SQL: Relational database management system (RDBMS) used for data storage.
